# FTODrawer
This is an application to draw the states on an FTO (Face Turning Octahedron).
Currently, this is a Simple GUI Java application that will display the U layer and the relevant information for the Last 3 Triples step as well as a full scramble image.

You can edit your color scheme in the Main.java file.  Change the colors in the colors String array to whatever you would like.  The order of the faces are as follows:
U, L, F, R, BR, B, BL, D faces (using standard notation).  If you do this, the .jar file will not reflect the color scheme and you will need to run it through the terminal.

If you are fine with the color scheme I use, you can run the program simply through the .jar file.

You can select either full scramble images or L3T images with the radio buttons on the top.  The default is a full scramble image.
Type your scramble into the text box labeled "Scramble".

Type the file without the extension in the text box labeled "Save File as:".

Click the "Save Image" button to save the image.

This image will be saved in the root of the FTODrawer folder as an SVG.
